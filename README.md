## Barclays Credit Rating & Downgraded Alert

This is a sample code extrated from the project I finished for my sponsor of Master Program, in this project. The data I worked on was a company's bond portfolio, every day, each bond will receive credit ratings from three different institutions: Fitch, S&P and Moody. I used the arclay's credit rating method with MySQL to generate rate for each bond every day. Besides, in order to help the manager capture the rating changes, I also finished a Downgraded Alert code to extract out the bond which was downgraded by whichever the three institutions.

## Position change

This sample code was for the sposnor to check the company's portfolio's position change everyday.
